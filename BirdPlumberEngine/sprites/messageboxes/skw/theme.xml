<width>8</width>
<height>8</height>
<!-- tilesize, this should be easy to understand.-->

<topsprite>topbar.bmp</topsprite>
<bottomsprite>bottombar.bmp</bottomsprite>
<!--basically, width*height, with the first of the 3 tiles being the edge, and everything else being the rest of the sprite. Final tile is the cursor, which shows up in the center of the dialogue box-->
<!-- this also could change, so i'd advise keeping borders very simple for now.-->

<sidesprite>sidebar.bmp</sidesprite>
<!--side sprite can be any size, but it's recommended to be w*1 to ensure easy stretching and no clipping.-->
<!--this might change later, though.-->
<fillsprite>fill.bmp</fillsprite>
<!-- i have literally no idea how im gonna implement this-->

<headerfont>0</headerfont>
<bodyfont>0</bodyfont>

<!-- since this is based on kekcroc world 3's dialogue box (or well, inspired by VWF by randomhacker)
i'm doing my best to keep the format similar at least for the header. Most isn't implememented yet!

<!-- if set to 0, then this box requires you to press A (controller) or X (keyboard) to continue the message.
Otherwise, the numer here represents how long the box should wait-->

<doanimation>true</doanimation>

<!-- does an animation to pull the box out. -->

<dotextblip>true</dotextblip>

<!-- should text blip out or just immediately print all? YOU DECIDE! -->

<!-- this is all for now, anticipate this file to grow.. tremendously. I also plan to have text stored in this file, but dunno if ill do that just yet. -->
<!-- might make a fork of DurangoMessager to handle this in a GUI context and let me write more java >:)-->
